# Barycentric rational approximation [![Build Status](https://github.com/c-f-h/baryrat/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/c-f-h/baryrat/actions/workflows/python-package.yml) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/baryrat.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/baryrat)

This is a pure Python package which provides routines for rational and
polynomial approximation for real and complex functions through the so-called barycentric representation.
The advantage of this representation is (often significantly) improved
stability over classical approaches.

See the [API documentation](https://baryrat.readthedocs.io/) for an overview of
the available functions.

## Features

### Best rational approximation using BRASIL

The package implements the novel BRASIL algorithm for best rational approximation;
see [the paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11075-020-01042-0) or
[the preprint](https://www.ricam.oeaw.ac.at/files/reports/20/rep20-37.pdf)
to learn more.

The following example computes the best uniform rational approximation of degree 5
to a given function in the interval [0, pi]:

```python
import numpy as np
import baryrat

def f(x): return np.sin(x) * np.exp(x)
r = baryrat.brasil(f, [0,np.pi], 5)
```

The rational function `r` can then be evaluated at arbitrary nodes, its poles computed,
and more. See the [documentation](https://baryrat.readthedocs.io/) for details.

### The AAA algorithm

The package includes a Python implementation of the AAA algorithm for rational
approximation described in the paper "The AAA Algorithm for Rational
Approximation" by Yuji Nakatsukasa, Olivier SÃ¨te, and Lloyd N. Trefethen, SIAM
Journal on Scientific Computing 2018 40:3, A1494-A1522.
[(doi)](https://doi.org/10.1137/16M1106122)

A MATLAB implementation of this algorithm is contained in
[Chebfun](http://www.chebfun.org/).  The present Python version is a more or
less direct port of the MATLAB version.

The "cleanup" feature for spurious poles and zeros is not currently implemented.

### Further algorithms

The package includes functions for polynomial interpolation, rational
interpolation with either fixed poles or fixed interpolation nodes,
Floater-Hormann interpolation, and more.

### Extended precision arithmetic

From ``baryrat`` 2.1 forward, most functions in the package support computing in extended precision
using the [`gmpy2`](https://pypi.org/project/gmpy2/) package; linear algebra routines are provided
through the [`flamp`](https://github.com/c-f-h/flamp) package.

To enable this, first install the `flamp` package:

    pip install flamp

This will automatically install `gmpy2` as well if it is not yet installed.

In your code, first set the desired number of decimal digits to compute with by

```python
import flamp
flamp.set_dps(100)  # compute with 100 decimal digits precision
```

Arrays of numbers should be represented as numpy arrays with the object datatype
containing `gmpy2` floating point numbers. Some convenience functions to create
such arrays are provided in `flamp`.
For instance, use `flamp.linspace(0, 1, 100)` to create equispaced points in
extended precision.

Most functions will autodetect if you pass such extended precision arrays and
use the corresponding extended precision arithmetic in that case. There is
also a `use_mp` flag for many functions, but it is only required to force
the use of extended precision even when the inputs are in double precision.

Also the `BarycentricRational` class supports having its nodes, values, and
weights stored in extended precision and will operate accordingly, for instance
when computing the poles.

## Installation

The package is implemented in pure Python and depends only on numpy and scipy,
with gmpy2 and flamp as optional dependencies as discussed above.
Install it using pip:

    pip install baryrat

## Usage

Here's an example of how to approximate a function in the interval [0,1]
using the AAA algorithm:

```python
import numpy as np
from baryrat import aaa

Z = np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, 1000)
F = np.exp(Z) * np.sin(2*np.pi*Z)

r = aaa(Z, F, mmax=10)
```

Instead of the maximum number of terms `mmax`, it's also possible to specify
the error tolerance `tol`.  Both arguments work exactly as in the MATLAB
version.

The returned object `r` is an instance of the class
`baryrat.BarycentricRational` and can be called like a function. For instance,
you can compute the error on `Z` like this:

```python
err = F - r(Z)
print(np.linalg.norm(err, np.inf))
```

If you are interested in the poles and residues of the computed rational function,
you can query them like

```python
pol, res = r.polres()
```

and the zeroes using

```python
zer = r.zeros()
```

Finally, the nodes, values and weights used for interpolation (called `zj`,
`fj` and `wj` in the original implementation) can be accessed as properties:

```python
r.nodes
r.values
r.weights
```

### Example: approximating the complex exponential

```python
# create 9 interpolation nodes in a circle
n = 9
nodes = exp(arange(n) / n * 2j * pi)

# interpolate the complex exp function as a degree (4,4) rational function
r = baryrat.interpolate_rat(nodes, exp(nodes))
# compute poles and zeros
poles, zer = r.poles(), r.zeros()

# plot the approximation error and the nodes, poles and zeros
figsize(13.5, 5)

subplot(1, 2, 1)
Y, X = ogrid[-2:2:100j, -2:2:100j]
Z = X + 1j * Y
pcolormesh(X.flat, Y.flat, abs(r(Z) - exp(Z)), norm=mpl.colors.LogNorm())
colorbar();
axis('equal');

subplot(1, 2, 2)
scatter(real(nodes), imag(nodes))
scatter(real(poles), imag(poles), marker='x', c='r')
scatter(real(zer), imag(zer), marker='.', c='g')
axis('equal');
```
